## About the Project

**Empty** is the first public Unity game project developed by:

- นครินทร์ บุญก่อเกื้อ  
- ธนกร ตะบอง  
- พิทักษ์ ปทุมวัน  

This project was developed over approximately 10 days, totaling around 70 hours of work. It serves both as a technical learning experience and a creative exploration of storytelling in game design.

## Game Description

You play as a detective who wakes up in his own home, disoriented and without any memories. Before he has time to process, his company contacts him with an urgent assignment — to investigate a mysterious murder case that has baffled everyone.

Forced to return to duty, the detective must now uncover the truth behind the case while also recovering the missing fragments of his own identity.
